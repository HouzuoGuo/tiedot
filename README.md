<p>2021-09-05: thanks for evaluating tiedot! The project started as a short programming exercise and I am very grateful for the small user base it has received. I am afraid the project has been dormant since 2016, the feature set is minimal and lacking for a modern application. Please consider other embedded DB engine alternatives. In the meanwhile, check out this actively maintained open source project of mine: <a href="https://github.com/HouzuoGuo/laitos">laitos - Top geek's chindogu</a>.</p>

### tiedot - Your NoSQL database powered by Golang

tiedot is a document database engine that uses __JSON__ as document notation; it has a powerful query processor that supports advanced set operations; it can be __embedded__ into your program, or run a stand-alone server using __HTTP__ for an API. It runs on *nix and Windows operating systems.

tiedot has fault-tolerant data structures that put your data safety *first*, while easily scales to 4+ CPU cores.

> tiedot has very stable performance, even with millions of records! It consistently achieves high throughput - swallow more than 120k records or 80k complicated queries per second with confidence.
